For Discord, Aeona wants to be a multifunctional all-in-one chatbot.
Slash commands will usher in a new era for Discord, but we must not lose sight of our legacy with message commands.
Aeona supports slash-based commands as well as message-based commands.

- The ability to support the greatest number of languages.
- A simple and intuitive codebase.
- Every aspect is customizable.
- The most recent version of Discordenoas soon as possible.

**Repository is based on [Menhera Bot](https://github.com/MenheraBot/MenheraBot)**
